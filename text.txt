   - Adjust camera and interaction for mobile devices

4. Code Structure Refactoring
   - Separate JavaScript into external file
   - Create reusable functions for planet/moon generation
   - Implement a configuration object for planetary properties

5. Enhanced Interactivity
   - Add zoom controls
   - Create a minimap or orbit overview
   - Implement more detailed tooltips
   - Add time-lapse orbital movement feature

6. Sound Design
